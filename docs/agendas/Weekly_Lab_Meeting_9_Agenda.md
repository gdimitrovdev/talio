4. Teamwork Self Reflection
   1.  Do we need citations for the team self reflection?
        >No, citations are not needed  
   2.  What is the correct structure of the reflection as I saw that Sebastian told us on MatterMost that we should remove the conclusion and introduction but some passed on the feedback with those still on there?
        >introductions and abstraction are not mandatory – 
       > you don’t have to cut them but they are not needed at all 
       > (if we have received a pass, it will be a pass the second time)

   3. Is the oral examination done alone? As a team together? Is everyone from the team on the same timeslot?
        >file containing questions will not be posted. Examination is done as a team. questions will be individual (question are from the code – technical questions – how was something implemented)
        >oral examination is pass/fail
        >presentation during oral examination:  whether there will be one , we will be told today
6. Admin mode
    1. We decided to have a password, and that this password will be passed as a program argument. Is this ok?
        >password as a program argument is okay ! Password implementation should be mentioned in the product pitch
7. ReadMe file
    1. What exactly are we supposed to write in the readMe file?
        >not mandatory, we don’t need to do it. It is an old file that we don’t need to place instructions
8. Product showcase
   1. Matei - fixed trying to join a board with an invalid code, did some minor optimizations to UI usability and wrote tests for the whole server(controllers and services)
   2. Pedro - Created tag management and admin functionality
   3. Dimana - Did client side testing, dialogues for confirmation
   4. George - Did long-polling, fixed card priority
   5. Agnese - Did shortcuts debugging
   6. Vesko - Did card color presets, password protection, reformatting the code
   >from product showcase: password protection epic is pretty extensive
   9. Additional Questions
       1. Does anyone have any other questions for the TA before the meeting closes?
        >   testing: we should focus on testing if it will bring out coverage significantly. From the rubric ‘indirection’ criterial : we diversify the tests – testing if the method calls the other methods correctly. Treating more boundry cases, checking what happens if there are exceptions what happens with the other methods. The REST endpoint is done via testing the controllers and it is okay since integration testing is not required.

       > about product pitch: focus on merging all first, then record and finally test, because it will take a lot of hours. What we could do: when one is done with recording their part, they start working on something else. We can test in parallel. It’s important to have everything merged into main.

    > About HUE feedback: TA’s feedback is that is good and our prioritization is okay and covers the ctitertia

10. Closure
