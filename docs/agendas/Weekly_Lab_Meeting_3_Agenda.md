# Weekly Lab Meeting 3 - Agenda 
*Notes on formatting:
Proposed places for the minute-taker to record the minutes during the meeting are noted in italics, between square brackets [].
The actual minutes don’t have to be in square brackets, but they should keep the italic styling, so that they are easy to distinguish.
The minutes don’t have to be a word-by-word exact record of what was said, they can be a quick and concise summary of the decisions taken by the team and the answers, feedback and suggestions given by the TA.*
