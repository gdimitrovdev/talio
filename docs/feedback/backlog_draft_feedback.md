### Backlog draft feedback


### Submission

Mark: Pass

Feedback: You could also upload the file in .pdf format if you wanted to include images in it.


### Backlog Structure

Mark: Pass

Feedback: The stakeholder list is quite bare, you could try to think of more entities that hold a stake in the application.


### Epics

Mark: Sufficient

Feedback: The list of epics is somewhat ambiguous. Were the big bullet points epics or were they meant to be something else? I suggest organizing a list of epics similar to the one shown in the lectures, and prioritizing it similarly. Don't forget to introduce an epic clearly. Optionally, you could also use mockups to complement the description.


### User Stories

Mark: Excellent

Feedback: The user stories are extensive and they follow the required format. They describe specific interactions well, and there are no obvious "gaps" feature-wise in them.


### Acceptance Criteria

Mark: Excellent

Feedback: The user stories are quite concise and clear, with only a few a bit longer or ambiguous.
