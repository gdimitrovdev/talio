# Feedback

1) Meeting organization: Pass - The chairman and minute taker were assigned from the previous meeting.

2) Agenda: Excellent - Agenda followed the template and covered all the relevant topics. 

3) Chair performance: Excellent - The chairman took the lead well in covering the agenda and involving everyone the discussions.  

4) Time management: Sufficient - The majority of the meeting was spent answering questions, and they were so many that they could not fit into 45 mins. Certain questions were not that relevant for the overall purpose of the course (e.g. the git rebase topic), and were taking from the time of more important topics.

5) Minute taker performance: Excellent - The minute taker was taking notes of everything important, and also asking questions to clarify points that they needed to write down. 

6) Attitude & Relation: Good - Not everybody was involved in the meeting. The chairman was the focal point of the meeting as there were always questions being asked, and most teammates did not get a chance to contribute to the discussions.

7) Potentially Shippable Product: Very good - The product at the moment is very well implemented and extensive, especially considering the little time you had from when you started coding. It would've been an Excellent feedback, if not for the fact that some features that were shown were not yet  merged into main, so not "shippable".
