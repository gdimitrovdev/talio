# Meeting Feedback

1) Meeting organization: Pass - The chairman and minute taker were assigned from the previous meeting.

2) Agenda: Excellent - Agenda followed the template and covered all the relevant topics.

3) Chair performance: Excellent - The chairman took the lead well in covering the agenda and trying to involve everyone the discussions. 

4) Time management: Very good - The time management this meeting was consistent with the improvement from the previous weeks. We managed to not go over the time limit this week and go through all the points that we needed to, thought the shippable product showcase was somewhat brief. 

5) Minute taker performance: Excellent - The notetaker was talking notes of the discussions and making sure that all important topics were written down.    
6) Attitude & Relation: Good - Not everybody was involved in the meeting. The chairman was the focal point of the meeting as there were a lot of questions being asked, and some teammates did not contribute to the discussions, despite the chair encouraging it. 

7) Potentially Shippable Product: Very good - The shippable product had many meaningful features added compared to last sprint, and especially the card editing functionality and tags seem to be really well implemented, with a very clean and intuitive to use UI. It would've been an "Excellent", if not for the fact that not all client-server communication has been merged into main. In this later stage of the project, strive to finish the Minimal Application requirements.
